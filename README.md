# LGANet-Registration

Image registration is a fundamental technique in the field of medical image analysis. Conventionally, it is approached as an iterative optimization methodology. Nevertheless, these methods are often time-intensive and their effectiveness diminishes when employed across diverse registration tasks. Recent advances in deep learning methodologies have significantly impacted the field of image registration, with attention mechanism-based methods showing remarkable success in deformable image registration. Despite advances in attention mechanisms that enhance feature learning, most current methods overlook the substantial variability in the local regions of the image being aligned, leading to less accurate estimations of deformation fields. 
In this study, we introduced an innovative methodology for deformable image registration that employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a feature interaction and fusion technique. This approach is designed to improve registration accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using four publicly available datasets, covering three distinct categories of registration tasks: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results show that our approach exceeded the performance of several state-of-the-art registration methods, as measured by DSC, HD95, and ASSD metrics. Notably, our approach yielded a significant improvement in the DSC score by 4.68\% in multi-modal CT-MR registration, and 1.46\% in cross-patient registration, outperforming the leading alternative methods.
